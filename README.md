## Installation

To install the application locally, ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/) installed, then clone the repository from Github and run the installation script `npm run install` followed by the start script `npm run start`. Ignore the seeding functionality as that component is still in progress.

## Usage

To explore the API, use a REST client such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or to view, create, update and delete (CRUD) routes. Check out this [walkthrough video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n4kMUS5w9XXwV7wZ008hdTlAYV0_BRqK/view) for reference.
